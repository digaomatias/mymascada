# Smart Transaction Categorization Tips

## Start with Broad Categories, Then Get Specific
Don't create too many categories at first. Start with these essential ones:
- **Housing** (rent, utilities, maintenance)
- **Transportation** (gas, insurance, maintenance)
- **Food** (groceries, dining out)
- **Healthcare** (insurance, doctor visits, medications)
- **Entertainment** (movies, subscriptions, hobbies)
- **Personal Care** (clothing, grooming, gym)
- **Savings & Investments**
- **Debt Payments** (loans, not credit cards)

## Use Subcategories Wisely
Once you have data, create subcategories for your biggest spending areas:
- Food → Groceries, Restaurants, Coffee, Takeout
- Transportation → Gas, Parking, Public Transit, Car Maintenance

## Consistency is Key
- Pick one approach and stick to it
- Amazon purchases: Categorize by what you bought, not where you bought it
- Costco trips: Split between groceries, household items, etc.

## Common Categorization Mistakes
1. **Creating too many categories** → You'll never use them consistently
2. **Being too specific early on** → Focus on patterns first
3. **Mixing stores with categories** → "Target" isn't a category, "Household Items" is
4. **Not categorizing transfers** → Money moving between your accounts isn't spending

## The 80/20 Rule
Focus on categorizing your largest expenses accurately. Don't stress over perfect categorization of every $5 purchase.

## Review and Adjust
- Check your categories monthly
- Merge similar categories if you have too many
- Split categories that are getting too large to be useful
