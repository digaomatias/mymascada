# Credit Card Payments: Avoid Double-Counting Your Expenses

## The Problem
Many people categorize credit card payments as "Credit Card Payments" in their expense tracking, which makes it appear as their highest spending category. But this creates a misleading picture of your finances.

## The Solution
**Treat credit card payments as transfers, not expenses.**

### Here's how it works:

1. **Categorize the original purchase** when you charge something to your credit card
   - Buy groceries for $100 → Categorize as "Groceries"
   - Fill up gas for $50 → Categorize as "Transportation"

2. **Treat the credit card payment as a transfer**
   - Pay $150 to your credit card → Categorize as "Transfer" or "Credit Card Payment" (but exclude from spending reports)

3. **Your spending reports stay accurate**
   - Shows $100 in Groceries and $50 in Transportation
   - Doesn't show $150 in "Credit Card Payments"

## Why This Matters
- **Accurate spending analysis**: See where your money actually goes
- **No double-counting**: Expenses are only counted once
- **Better budgeting**: Make decisions based on real spending patterns
- **Clear financial picture**: Understand your true cash flow

## Special Cases
- **Interest and fees**: These ARE actual expenses, categorize them as "Interest & Fees"
- **Cash advances**: Treat the advance as income and the payment as paying back debt
- **Rewards/cashback**: Can be treated as income or expense reduction

## Pro Tip
If you carry a balance, separate the interest from the principal payment. Only the interest is a true expense - the principal payment is debt reduction.
