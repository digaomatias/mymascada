# Budgeting Basics: Start Simple, Stay Consistent

## The 50/30/20 Rule (A Great Starting Point)
- **50% Needs**: Housing, utilities, groceries, minimum debt payments
- **30% Wants**: Entertainment, dining out, hobbies, subscriptions
- **20% Savings**: Emergency fund, investments, extra debt payments

## Build Your Budget in Steps

### Step 1: Track Before You Budget
- Record all expenses for at least one month
- Don't try to change spending habits yet - just observe
- You can't budget money you don't know you're spending

### Step 2: Start with Fixed Expenses
- Rent/mortgage
- Insurance payments
- Loan minimums
- Subscriptions

### Step 3: Set Realistic Variable Budgets
- Base limits on your actual spending patterns
- Don't cut everything to $0 immediately
- Allow for small indulgences to stay motivated

### Step 4: Plan for Irregular Expenses
- Car maintenance
- Holiday gifts
- Annual subscriptions
- Home repairs

## Common Budgeting Mistakes
1. **Being too restrictive** → You'll give up quickly
2. **Forgetting irregular expenses** → They'll blow your budget
3. **Not adjusting for reality** → Your budget should reflect your life
4. **Focusing only on big expenses** → Small recurring charges add up

## The Envelope Method (Digital Style)
- Assign every dollar a job before you spend it
- When a category is empty, you're done spending in that area
- Move money between categories as needed, but consciously

## Emergency Fund Priority
Before aggressive budgeting, build a small emergency fund:
- Start with $500-$1000
- Keep it in a separate, easily accessible account
- This prevents small emergencies from derailing your budget

## Review and Adjust Monthly
- Compare actual spending to budgeted amounts
- Adjust categories that are consistently over/under
- Celebrate wins and learn from overspending
